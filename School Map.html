    <p>This is a map of our beautiful school. There are Designated areas of learning within our premisis. In each of these designated areas a key learning aspect is taught Technology and PE just to name a few. At each of these locations you will find the Head Of Learning Area for that specific area. Feel free to have a chat with these kind staff. (Please refer to "Our Staff" for more.) As for less learning defined areas you have great options such as Te Kirikiri based in the beautiful centre of our school. This combined with our brand new gym area provides great playable areas for lively students wanting to burn off some energy. Among all of this at the main entrance/cafe area of school we have a canteen that sells a very wide range of food that is fairly priced. This is open Break 2 and 3 and before/after school. </p>
